<p> If there was ever a competition for cooking up the fieriest delicacies, a native of Andhra Pradesh or Telangana would certainly win away all the glory. Red chilli is produced in abundance in these states which makes it a hot favourite among the all the locals. Take a bite of any authentic Telugu dish and you are sure to fan your mouth cool right after the very first bite!</p>
<p>While talking of Andhra cuisine, it is important to keep the split of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in mind. After Telangana attained its identity as a separate state, a lot many mouthwatering jewels - that were once bracketed with Andhra Pradesh - shifted to become a Telangana exclusive. Interestingly, the two states are quite diverse yet much similar in their style of cooking. The curries, vadas and pachadis would all be the same but with different ingredients. Gongura leaves and red chillies are peculiar to both Andhra and Telangana delicacies. These are widely used in preparing some of the most scrumptious pickles, chutneys(pachadi) and curries.</p>
